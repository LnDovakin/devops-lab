# DevOps / Infrastructure Learning Lab

## About
I'm starting my path into infrastructure and DevOps.
My goal is to get a DevOps / Infra internship and build real practical skills.

## Current focus
- Linux environment
- Bash scripting
- Docker & basic deployment
- Git & CI fundamentals

## Why this repo exists
I learn best through practice, not theory.
This repository is a lab where I build small, working things
and document what I learn along the way.

## Plan (first steps)
- Set up Linux environment (WSL + Ubuntu)
- Learn basic terminal commands
- Write simple Bash scripts
- Create a small service and run it with Docker

## Status
Day 0 — repository created.
